# 100-Days-of-Python

Welcome to my #100DaysOfPython journey! This repository documents my daily progress and projects as I commit to learning and practicing Python for the next 100 days. Follow along to witness my growth, challenges, and the evolution of my Python programming skills.

## Motivation

I've embarked on this 100-day coding challenge to deepen my understanding of Python and its vast ecosystem. Through daily coding exercises, projects, and learning resources, I aim to become proficient in Python development and build a strong foundation for tackling real-world programming tasks.

## Goals

- **Daily Commits:** I commit to coding and pushing changes to this repository every day for the next 100 days.
- **Projects:** I will work on a variety of projects to apply what I learn and showcase my progress.
- **Community Engagement:** I encourage collaboration, feedback, and discussions from the coding community. Feel free to open issues, provide suggestions, or connect with me on social media.

## Progress

| Day | Focus | Achievements |
| --- | ----- | ------------ |
| 01  | Basics of Python | Completed exercises on variables, data types, and basic operations. |
| 02  | Control Flow | Implemented conditional statements and loops. |
| 03  | Functions | Explored function definitions, parameters, and return values. |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Projects

1. **Simple ToDo App:** Create a basic ToDo application to practice handling lists and user input.

2. **Web Scraper:** Build a web scraper using BeautifulSoup to extract data from a website.

3. **API Integration:** Connect to a public API and retrieve information using the `requests` library.

## Resources

I'll be using various online resources, tutorials, and documentation. Some of the key resources include:

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Codecademy Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/)
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

Feel free to join me on this journey or share your insights. Let's code together! ðŸš€
